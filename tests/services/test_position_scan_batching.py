"""The position scan asks the chain once, not once per token.

`list_positions` looks at two tokens for every market the account has ever
touched. Reading those one at a time is invisible on a local node and brutal
on a remote one: measured against production, an account with 504 trades took
23.6 seconds to render fourteen rows, and the cost tracked the number of
markets touched rather than the number of positions returned.
