"""The ceiling on `POST /auth/code`.

That endpoint is unauthenticated, is the only door into the product since the
cutover, and every request that reaches WorkOS costs an email. So these tests
care about two things a status code alone cannot show: that a refused request
is refused BEFORE WorkOS is called, and that the two rules key on different
subjects so neither leaves the other's hole open.

The service is driven directly rather than over HTTP wherever the limit itself
is the subject. Going through `TestClient` would mean sending the production
allowance -- twenty requests per address, sixty per IP -- for every assertion.
The two HTTP tests below are the ones that need the route: they check the
status code, the header, and that the client IP reaches the rule at all.
