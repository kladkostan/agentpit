"""What one account actually did on one trade row.

`trades.PRICE` is always the MAKER's price and `trades.ASSET_ID` is always the
TAKER's token. That is the whole truth for a NORMAL match, where both parties
transact in the same token at the same price. It is not for the two special
kinds:

| kind   | the taker's leg                  | the maker's leg                     |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| NORMAL | ASSET_ID, side SIDE, price p      | ASSET_ID, opposite of SIDE, price p  |
| MINT   | ASSET_ID, BUY, price MICRO - p    | MAKER_ASSET_ID, BUY, price p         |
| MERGE  | ASSET_ID, SELL, price MICRO - p   | MAKER_ASSET_ID, SELL, price p        |

A MINT mints a complementary pair for $1, so both sides ACQUIRE, of different
tokens, at prices summing to MICRO. A MERGE burns one, so both sides DISPOSE.

This is the per-user view: a NORMAL match yields TWO legs, the buyer's and the
seller's. Do not confuse it with a price print, where a NORMAL match yields
exactly ONE — see `TOKEN_PRINTS_CTE` in `agentpit/db/table_read.py`.
