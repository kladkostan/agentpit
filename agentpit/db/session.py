        already there. That is harmless for the API, which runs it once before
        serving, but a one-off script that opens its own session against a
        LIVE database is a second writer racing the API for locks on every
        table — and it deadlocks:

            markets; blocked by process B. Process B waits for
            AccessShareLock on a relation A already holds.

        Scripts in `scripts/` connect to a database the API has already
